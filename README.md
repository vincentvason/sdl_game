- Game development using C++ Language and SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) on Visual Studio 2022. This project demonstrates C++ principles, programming patterns, and algorithms. This project also includes three practice exercises: Tic-tac-toe, Pong, and Space Invaders.
- Level editor created with C# WFP application (.NET 8.0)

## Witch in The Woods
Witch in The Woods is the top-down shooting game. You control the witch and try to survive in the woods and creatures. This game demonstrates C++ skills and algorithms such as:
- C++ and SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) library. (Special Thanks to [Lazy Foo' Productions](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php))
- OOP principles such as Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Design Patterns such as State, Singleton and Flyweight (Special Thanks to [Game Programming Patterns â€“ Robert Nystrom](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/))

In the current version, you can play with 1 player and 1 stage with unlimited creatures. Try your best to survive as long as possible.
